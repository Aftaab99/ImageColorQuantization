## Image Compression/Color Quantization using K-Means

Implemented K-Means algorithm from scratch in C++ for compressing a RGB image  into another image having the *K* most dominant colours. Used opencv for Image reading and processing.

Make sure you have opencv C++ installed, then run,

	g++ KMeansCompressv2.cc -o output `pkg-config --libs opencv`
